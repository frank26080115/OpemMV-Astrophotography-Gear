Using OpenMV to assist in astrophotography!

I made a Polar Scope and Autoguider using OpenMV

A polar scope is used to polar-align star-tracking camera mounts and equatorial telescope mounts. A digital camera version that leverages OpenMV computer vision algorithms can achieve much better accuracy, improving the quality of astro-photographs! With a WiFi connected web UI, it's way more convenient to use.

An autoguider is something that locks onto one star, and commands a computerized telescope mount to move in tiny steps to follow that one star, thus correcting for any errors in motor speed and alignment. This prevents blurriness in astrophotographs in extra long exposures.
